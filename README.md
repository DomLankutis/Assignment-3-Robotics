# Assignment 3 Robotics 

Our team built a morse code converter using an arduino.
You can run the program by using the ```autorun.bat``` file,
this will compile the code in the ```main.ino``` file and uploads it to the
arduino after that the the autorun script will run the **Serial Monitor** and will let you know once the device is ready. Once the device is ready you cant start inputing your message and it will be converted to morse code !  


## Introduction - 




_What is morse code?_
Morse code is an alphabet or code in which letters

are representedby combinations of long and short light or sound signals.
