## Introduction - 

Our team built a morse code using an arduio.



We run the program using the autorun.bat file,
this file complies the code and uploads it to the arduino and then runs the serial monitor
and this is  where we input the message. **:)**  

_What is morse code?_
Morse code is an alphabet or code in which letters are represented
by combinations of long and short light or sound signals.
